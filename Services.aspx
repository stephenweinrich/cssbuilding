                                            Consultation during the planning phase of a construction project has many advantages.
                                            Master builders are able to forecast and diminish potential difficulties that can
                                            arise due to design, engineering, terrain, estate controls and municipal regulations
                                            to mention a few. A practical and experienced eye during the infancy of a project
                                            can be of major financial benefit. Project management from inception to completion
                                            is our preference and can eliminate many pitfalls.
